# C229-G1
Final Project for Web Development Course, Group 1

The original project was to create a "Soccer Team Management" web application using ASP.NET MVC Core, and implement whatever features we deemed to be useful into it, using only methods that we learned throughout the course.

Standard features that needed to be implemented were:
- Adding/Editing a Club
- Adding Players to a Club
- Login system with two types of users: Admin and General (and anonymous user)

Additional features that were implemented were:
- Editing of Players
- Registration page for General users
- Viewing of users page for Admin, along with possible deletion of users
- Log page of actions for Admin so that they can view any changes made by any user to a Club or Player
